# ✅ Pro-Tasker Frontend – MERN Full-Stack Capstone

A modern, responsive project management interface for **Pro-Tasker**, a collaborative MERN stack application built for individuals and small teams to manage projects and tasks efficiently.

The frontend communicates with a secure backend API and delivers authentication, project workflows, and task management through a dynamic React + TypeScript application.

## ⚠️ Render Hosting Notice

This application is hosted using **Render's free tier**.

The backend service may enter **hibernation after periods of inactivity**.
When accessing the live demo for the first time:

- Initial requests may take **10–30 seconds** to respond
- This delay occurs while the backend service wakes up
- After activation, the application performs normally

This behavior is expected for free-tier deployments.
