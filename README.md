# ✅ Pro-Tasker Frontend – MERN Full-Stack Capstone

A modern, responsive project management interface for **Pro-Tasker**, a collaborative MERN stack application built for individuals and small teams to manage projects and tasks efficiently.

The frontend communicates with a secure backend API and delivers authentication, project workflows, and task management through a dynamic React + TypeScript application.

## ⚠️ Render Hosting Notice

This application is hosted using **Render's free tier**.

The backend service may enter **hibernation after periods of inactivity**.
When accessing the live demo for the first time:

- Initial requests may take **10–30 seconds** to respond
- This delay occurs while the backend service wakes up
- After activation, the application performs normally

This behavior is expected for free-tier deployments.

---

## 🔗 Backend API

Local Development Endpoint:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

Production Endpoint:

```
https://backend-b-0xau.onrender.com
```

API configuration is handled within:

```
frontend/src/utils/api/axiosInstance.ts
frontend/.env
```


---

## 💻 Running Locally

### Prerequisites

* Node.js **18+** (Node 20 LTS recommended)
* npm **9+**
* Pro-Tasker Backend API running locally or deployed

The frontend requires a live backend connection for authentication and data loading.

---

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file inside the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Environment Notes**

* Use the **backend base URL only** (do not include `/api`)
* API routes are automatically appended by the frontend
* Production example:

```bash
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
```

---

### Install Dependencies

Inside the `frontend/` directory:

```bash
npm install
```

---

### Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Application runs at:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

---

### Backend Requirement

Ensure the backend server is running and accessible before launching the frontend.

Expected local backend URL:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

---

## 🔗 Backend Repository

The Pro-Tasker frontend connects to a separate MERN backend responsible for authentication, API routing, and data management.

👉 **Backend Source Code:**
[https://github.com/structbase/Pro-Tasker-Backend](https://github.com/structbase/Pro-Tasker-Backend)]

The backend provides:

* JWT authentication and authorization
* RESTful API endpoints
* MongoDB data persistence
* Project and task management logic
* Secure user data handling
